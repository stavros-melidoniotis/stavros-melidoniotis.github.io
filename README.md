My personal portfolio website.

The previous version of this portfolio was based on a pre-made Bootstrap theme, so I challenged myself to design and implement this one from scratch, in order to practice my front-end skills. 

The theme is based on Visual Studio Code, the famous code editor from Microsoft.         

More features will be added in the future!    
If you like what you are seeing you can star this repository.
