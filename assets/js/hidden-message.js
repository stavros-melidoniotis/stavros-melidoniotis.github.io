    Hey! I'm glad you made it here. This means you are a curious human being like me.

    The previous version of this portfolio was based on a pre-made Bootstrap theme, so I
    challenged myself to design and implement this one from scratch, in order to practice
    my front-end skills. The theme is based on Visual Studio Code, the famous code editor 
    from Microsoft. 
    
    More features coming soon!

    If you like what you are seeing you can star the repository in my Github account.
